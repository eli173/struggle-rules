\subsection*{Torus}
Designate a piece to use this power (traditionally blue).
This piece treats the board as if it wraps around horizontally.
That is, if the Torus piece is on the edge, it can move to the opposite edge of the same row, and can jump similarly.
Further, when this piece encounters an edge moving forward, it may move forward as if it were in the opposite spot on its row (illustrated below).

\subsection*{Caboose}

If three or more of your nonwhite pieces line up in a row,
you can use your turn to advance all the pieces one step in the direction of the line.

\subsection*{Teleporter}

Choose a piece to be your teleporter (traditionally blue).
This piece can move regularly, or it can use the power of teleportation.
If the power is used, the teleporter may move to any open space not behind it within three spaces of itself.
When the power is used, the pieces over which the teleporter moves are not considered jumped.

Below, the blue piece is our teleporter, and all spaces he is able to move to are highlighted. The jumps drawn below indicate that the teleporter can also move regularly to these spots using the standard movement rules for jumping. A space is highlighted green if the piece can move there by means of teleporter, purple if the piece can move there by teleporting, and red if the piece can only reach the spot by moving regularly.

\subsection*{Armor}

Choose one piece to be your armored piece.
This piece must be jumped twice to be removed.

\newpage

\subsection*{Grim Reaper}

Choose one piece to be your Grim Reaper (traditionally black).
When one of your non-Grim Reaper (and nonwhite) pieces is removed,
the Grim Reaper moves to the spot where that piece was at the end of the turn. If multiple pieces of yours are removed on the same turn, the Grim Reaper goes to the place where the last piece to be removed was.
In the case where multiple pieces are removed simultaneously,
you may choose which piece the Grim Reaper will replace.

Below, the black, red and blue pieces are yours,
and the green is your opponent's.
The images show the progression of a turn in which one of your pieces is captured.

\

\begin{center}
  \begin{struggleboard}
    \piece{g2}{red};
    \piece{f2}{green};
    \piece{f5}{black};
    \piece{h4}{blue};
    \move{f2}{h3};
  \end{struggleboard}
  \begin{struggleboard}
    \piece{h3}{green};
    \piece{f5}{black};
    \piece{h4}{blue};
    \move{f5}{g2};
  \end{struggleboard}
  \begin{struggleboard}
    \piece{g2}{black};
    \piece{h4}{blue};
    \piece{h3}{green};
  \end{struggleboard}
\end{center}

\

In the above, the green takes your red, and when the turn finishes,
your black moves to where your red was.

\

\begin{center}
  \begin{struggleboard}
    \piece{g2}{red};
    \piece{f2}{green};
    \piece{f5}{black};
    \piece{h4}{blue};
    \move{f2}{h3};
    \move{h3}{h5};
  \end{struggleboard}
  \begin{struggleboard}
    \piece{h5}{green};
    \piece{f5}{black};
    \move{f5}{h4};
  \end{struggleboard}
  \begin{struggleboard}
    \piece{h4}{black};
    \piece{h5}{green};
  \end{struggleboard}
\end{center}

\

Here, the enemy green captured your red and then your blue,
so the black moves to where the last piece to be taken was.
