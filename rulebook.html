<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Overview and Objective</h4>
<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >Each player has a team of 6 pieces of 6 different colors: white, black, blue, green, red,
and yellow. Pieces generally move by moving to adjacent spaces or by jumping over
other pieces; enemy pieces are captured when they are jumped. A player wins in one
of two circumstances:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">he captures his opponent&#8217;s white, or
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">he moves his white across the board to his opponent&#8217;s white&#8217;s starting
     position</li></ul>
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   Before the game begins, each player chooses three different Rules from the Rule
list. These Powers are used throughout the game to extend the abilities of single
pieces or of the whole team.
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Board and Setup</h4>
<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >Struggle is played on a modified Chinese checkers board in which 4 of the 6
home-base triangles have been sectioned off, leaving a diamond-shaped Struggle
board. The first layer of the inner diamond and the last spaces on either side of the
middle row are also sectioned off, so that the diamond&#8217;s sides are 6 spaces
long.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   Players set up pieces at either end of the diamond. White is placed in the first
space facing the player (a row containing only one space), and the other five pieces
are placed in the next two rows as the player wishes. (In competitive games, players
may want to secretly decide on their starting positions and reveal them
simultaneously.)
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   An example starting board is pictured below.
<div class="center"

<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >
                                                                  

                                                                  
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0;<object data="rulebook-1.svg" width="100.14687 " height="208.14308 " type="image/svg+xml"><p>SVG-Viewer needed.</p></object>

<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>&#x00A0;ovement and Capture</h4>
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >Players make 1 move per turn. Non-Rule (conventional) movement consists of either
(1) moving to an adjacent, unoccupied space or (2) jumping over an adjacent piece
with an unoccupied space directly behind it, in the direction of the jump (as in
checkers or Chinese checkers). A player may jump both his own and his opponent&#8217;s
pieces: when an opponent&#8217;s piece is jumped, it is removed from the board unless a
Power which says otherwise is invoked.
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   Conventional movement cannot be backwards: pieces moving conventionally must
step or jump either forward (diagonally) or horizontally. After performing a
conventional jump, a piece may continue to jump over jumpable pieces. A piece
which is allowed to jump adjacent pieces after a jump is said to have &#8216;bounce&#8217;.
A piece which has just performed a conventional movement is said to be
landing.
<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>The White Piece and Zapping</h4>
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >The game ends when either (1) one player&#8217;s white piece is captured or (2) one
player&#8217;s white piece lands in the opponent&#8217;s white&#8217;s starting position.
<!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   When a player&#8217;s white lands on the fourth row from his opponent (the 10th row
from his perspective), any pieces in the opponent&#8217;s home base (the rows in which his
pieces began) are immediately captured: they are said to be &#8216;zapped&#8217;. This is to
guard against camping of the home base.
                                                                  

                                                                  
<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>Special Rules</h4>
<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >On the following pages, there is a list of special rules used to enhance the
game. Before the game, you and your opponent choose three rules from the
following list. These rules give the game variety; with just a handful of rules
you get hundreds of combinations, so you could play a different game each
time. The rules vary in scope and effect: some apply every turn, some are
only used once or twice a game, some grant greater offensive capabilities,
others improve your defense, and others are used to trap your opponent or
trick him or her into a dangerous situation. When choosing rules, think
about how the rules play with and against each other, and how certain rules
might or might not fit your style or give you the expressiveness in play you
want.
<!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   Rules are intended to make the game more fun, interesting, and deep. Players are
encouraged to develop their own Rules, sets of Rules, and strategies based
around them. We have found that using the following guidelines to help us
come up with rules that make the game more interesting and keep it fairly
balanced:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Avoid making Rules that affect white
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Ban the stacking of Rules which are broken in combination
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Avoid making Rules that tend to stall the game
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Shoot for rules that are both fun to play with and against</li></ul>
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >Feel free to follow all, some, or even none of these guidelines. The most important thing
about designing rules is making sure that the rule makes the game more fun or
interesting for you to play.
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>Torus</h4>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >Designate a piece to use this power (traditionally blue). This piece treats the
board as if it wraps around horizontally. That is, if the Torus piece is on
the edge, it can move to the opposite edge of the same row, and can jump
similarly. Further, when this piece encounters an edge moving forward, it
may move forward as if it were in the opposite spot on its row (illustrated
below).
