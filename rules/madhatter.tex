\subsection*{Mad Hatter}

At the beginning of your turn you may choose two nonwhite pieces of yours and swap their positions. Afterwards, you may move or otherwise continue your turn. If either of the pieces you swapped have rules assigned to them, you may not use these rules. Once you have used this power,
you may not use it again until you move three more times.
