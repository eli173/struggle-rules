\subsection*{Tumbling Tower}

At the beginning of the game,
designate one non-white piece with the ability to lay tumbling-towers.
When this piece moves,
it may leave the base of a tower in the space it just left.
(For the pieces of the tower, use checkers, coins,
or some other stackable object that can fit on one space.)
The tower must be laid in the middle five rows.
This tower may not be landed on by any piece,
and may only be jumped over by your pieces.
When one of your non-white pieces jumps over the tower,
add one level to the tower
(white may jump over the tower, but not add levels).
The tower has a maximum height of three pieces.
The range of the tower is the heigh of the tower minus one.
That is, if the tower has 2 levels, its range is 1,
and if it has 3 levels, its range is 2.
When a non-white enemy piece lands within the tower's range
(e.g. if the tower is 3 levels high, the piece lands within
2 spaces of the tower),
the tower 'falls' (is removed from the board)
and all non-white enemy pieces in the tower's range
are removed from the board. 
You may have only 1 tower on the board at a time,
but may lay as many as you like during the course of the game. 

Below, the green is your piece which is allowed to lay tumbling tower,
and the blue and yellow pieces are also yours.
The red and black pieces belong to your opponent.
The tumbling tower is denoted by a brown piece here.
Your green begins by laying a tumbling tower, and as the moves progress,
your opponent moves towards you and you add on to the tumbling tower.
The range of the tower is marked by an orange highlight.
Note that if an enemy piece is within the new range of the tumbling tower
when you add to its range, the fall is not triggered, as the fall is
only triggered by enemy movement within the range.
